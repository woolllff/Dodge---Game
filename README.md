#OVERVIEW

##1. Idea

This game is a classic game about dodging obstacles and reaching the end of the game,
But the twist is when you reach level 3 the speed becomes very high with makes it near to impossible to complete,
but the user dose not know that and is stuck with the idea of completing, hence plays for hours and hours and thus
making the game a hit.

##2. Project Scope

The project can be released on several platforms and more levels as well as obstacles can be added to make it
more challenging and interesting for the user. The limitations as of now is that it only has three levels and not a lot
of obstacles.

##3. Technology used and implementation details

The project is made using unity game engine and is scripted in C# .
For this I used a lot of inbuilt functions and libraries of unity and a basic level of C# was needed to code it into It
Unity engine provides a lot of libraries and some of them used are UnityEngine , UnityEngine.UI ,
UnityEngine.SceenManagement ETC;
There are variables available for not only using RAM but the disk memory i.e permanent storage .

##4. Overall Experience

Making this project I learnt a lot of useful stuff such as C# language , Unity editor . And I also learnt how to work and
deliver under the deadline. And not to mention I also learnt how to debug and produce a desired result .
